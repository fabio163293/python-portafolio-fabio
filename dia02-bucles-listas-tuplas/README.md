# ðŸ“… Python Intensive â€“ Day 2

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Strengthen understanding of core data structures in Pythonâ€”**lists** and **tuples**â€”as well as conditional logic and iteration. Practice working with user input, filtering data, and manipulating collections.

---

## âœ… Topics Covered
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Error handling with `try/except`
- List creation and manipulation
- Tuple declaration and access
- Conversion between lists and tuples
- Filtering and counting with logic conditions

## ðŸ§© Files Developed

| File Name           | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `par_impar.py`      | Prompts the user for a number and checks if it is even or odd.              |
| `lista_frutas.py`   | Creates and modifies a list of fruits; uses insert, replace, extend, and pop.|
| `tupla.py`          | Works with a list of tuples (name, age, country); filters and counts values.|
| `Imprimir_pares.py` | Accepts user input to build a list, converts it to a tuple, prints even numbers.|

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings
- How to safely collect and validate input from users.
- Effective use of lists and tuples to store and process structured data.
- Practical experience with conditional logic for data filtering.
- Importance of readability and structure in small scripts.

## ðŸ“Œ Developer Note

This project is part of my personal daily Python intensive learning plan.  
Day 2 files include **comments in Spanish only**.  
Starting from **Day 3**, all code will include comments in **both Spanish and English** to support international readability and professional portfolio standards.
