# ðŸ“… Python Intensive â€“ Day 3

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Enhance logic and control flow skills in Python by using **nested conditionals** and working with **dictionaries**. Focus on real-world applications such as data lookup, frequency counting, and data filtering.

---

## âœ… Topics Covered
- Nested conditionals (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
- Dictionary creation and manipulation
- Iteration with `zip()` and `.items()`
- Case normalization with `.lower()`
- Input validation

| File Name                   | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `clasificacion_edad.py`     | Classifies user age into child, teenager, adult, or senior using nested conditionals. |
| `diccionario_estudiantes.py`| Finds the student with the highest grade from a dictionary of names and scores. |
| `diccionario_productos.py`  | Lets the user search for a product and returns its price if found.          |
| `contador_letras.py`        | Counts how many times each letter appears in a user-entered sentence.       |

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings
- Mastered the use of dictionaries to store and retrieve related data.
- Applied control flow and conditions to filter, compare and manage user input.
- Practiced iterating over multiple sequences simultaneously using `zip()`.
- Reinforced best practices like using `.get()` to safely access dictionary keys.
- Built real-world utilities such as a letter frequency analyzer and data lookups.

## ðŸ“Œ Developer Note

This is part of my personal Python intensive training plan.  
All files are created from scratch and include **comments in both Spanish and English** starting from this day.  
Exercises were tested, refined, and prepared for publishing in my professional GitHub portfolio.
